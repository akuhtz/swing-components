##5. JIPTextField:

JIPTextField is IP Address Control supporting both IPV4 &amp; IPV6. The functionality of JIPTextField is similar to the IP Address control found in Windows. For an example, if the value entered is greater than 255 then it defaults to 255. Also, you can use Tab to navigate from one octet to another within the JIPTextField.
